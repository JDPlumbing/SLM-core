**Structured Language Model (SLM) Architecture Overview**

---

## Objective

Design a hybrid semantic system that combines deterministic tuple-based encoding (SLM) with optional probabilistic overlays and an expressive LLM interface. The goal is to create a lightweight, high-trust, fully auditable alternative to traditional LLMs for structured logging, simulation, and reasoning in task-driven domains (e.g., plumbing workflows).

## System Layers

### 1. **Tuple Engine (SLM Core)**

* **Input**: Discrete semantic units (verbs, objects, roles, etc.)
* **Structure**: Fixed-length strings (e.g., 64 bytes, 32 x 2-byte tokens)
* **Dictionaries**: 32 enums, each defining an axis of meaning (e.g., verb, object, status, cause, location)
* **Encoding/Decoding**: Direct 2-byte indexing into dictionaries
* **Storage**: Compact binary logs, optional hash chains for trust
* **Speed**: Near-instantaneous; suitable for microcontroller-level devices

### 2. **Markov Overlay (Optional Statistical Memory)**

* **Purpose**: Learn patterns from encoded tuples (e.g., what action usually follows another)
* **Structure**: n-gram or transition table per dictionary slot
* **Use Cases**:

  * Predict likely next tuples
  * Detect anomalies or rare sequences
  * Suggest auto-completions or corrective paths

### 3. **Bridge Layer**

* **Role**: Router/Translator between tuple layer and LLM interface
* **Tasks**:

  * Convert natural input to tuple form
  * Feed tuple chains to LLM for explanation or elaboration
  * Accept LLM-suggested ideas and route back to tuple format

### 4. **LLM Integration Layer (Optional)**

* **Purpose**: Natural language interface for non-technical users
* **Functions**:

  * Summarize tuple chains
  * Explain anomalies or deviations
  * Generate human-readable documentation from logs
  * Accept flexible inputs and route through Bridge Layer

## Key Design Principles

* **Determinism First**: Tuple layer always executes exactly and predictably.
* **Compression Native**: Entire system should operate efficiently in 64 bytes per event.
* **Explainability**: Every 2-byte token has a defined meaning and reversible transformation.
* **Modularity**: Each layer functions independently, and can be swapped or skipped.
* **Trust/Verification**: Event chains can be signed, hashed, or anchored for audit and sync.

---

## Future Extensions

* **Learning Scores**: Confidence tables for Markov predictions
* **Embedded Agent Simulation**: Run agents through tuple logic to simulate decisions
* **Offline Sync**: Chaincodes for field-device offline trust propagation
* **Composable Events**: Event macros, nesting, and recursive subchains

---

## Applications

* Plumbing event logs (e.g., installs, tests, inspections)
* Field diagnostics and step-by-step repair logging
* Training systems for apprentices
* Permitting workflows and jurisdiction-specific code mapping
* Trusted event records for client billing or documentation
